Currently it provides the ability to:

* **Choose a device** from the list of connected devices;
* **Reboot the device** to:
  * System
  * Recovery
  * Bootloader
* **Take screenshot** from the device and save it to your computer;
* **Install an APK to device** by a simple drag'n'drop.

## Installation

* Grab latest binary from the Releases page and unpack it to the Applications folder on your Mac;
* [Download latest Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) from the official site (or install them via Homebrew: `brew cask install android-sdk`);
* Run application, and specify the path to platform tools (if you're using Homebrew it will be `/usr/local/share/android-sdk/platform-tools`).

## Usage

* Activate the developer mode on your device (tap 5-7 times on build number in About section in Settings), navigate to Developer options and enable USB debugging;
* Once you have connected your device, the application should automatically detect it and show you the available actions.
